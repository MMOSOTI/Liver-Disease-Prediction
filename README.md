This project uses kaggle Liver Disease data to analyse the risk factors for Liver disease. We analyse the correlation between the Diagnosis( the Dependent Variable) and several independent variables(Age, Gender, BMI, AlcoholConsumption, Smoking, GeneticRisk, PhysicalActivity, Diabetes, Hypertension and LiverFunctionTest). We carry out data wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Dataset before training and testing various models, evaluate and compare them  to establish the best for prediction of  Liver Disease. The results show that the Decision Tree is the most accurate model to use for prediction. We conclude that AlcoholConsumption, ,smoking and Gender are the major predictors of Liver Disease Diagnosis.
